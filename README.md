## Japan

I don't want a pickle  
Just want to ride on my motorcycle ("sickel")  
And I don't want a tickle  
'Cause I'd rather ride on my motorcycle  
And I don't want to die  
I just want to ride on my motor-cy ... cul

## Logistics Questions

### Luggage & Storage
- Where do big suitcases stay during the trip? (rental shop storage, hotel, luggage forwarding service)  
- Do bikes come with panniers/top cases or only a rack?  
- Minimum daily storage — Dopp kit, meds, headlamp, charger.  
- Helmet lock / cable lock needed for stops?  

### Laundry & Clothing
- Plan to do laundry mid-trip (coin laundromat, hotel washer) or pack for all 6 days?  
- Quick-dry layers for sink washing vs. cotton bulk?  
- Schedule a laundry day in Matsumoto or Aizu?  

### Accommodations
- Book all stays a week+ in advance, night before, or roll into town?  
- October = peak leaf season — will walk-ins be available?  
- Confirm motorcycle parking at each inn/ryokan.  
- Cancellation flexibility (Booking.com, Rakuten Travel)?  

### Bikes & Rental Practicalities
- What models available (dual-sport vs. ADV-tourer)?  
- Insurance coverage: does it include roadside/towing?  
- Add-on panniers/top case available?  
- How are tolls handled (ETC card vs. cash)?  
- GPS mounts included, or bring RAM mounts?  

### Rider Communication
- Helmet comms (Cardo/Sena) or just hand signals?  
- Backup: group chat + live location sharing (LINE/WhatsApp/Google).  
- Agreed signals for stop, hazard, fuel, slow down, speed up.  
- Portable battery packs for phones/GPS.  

### Group Riding & Separation
- Ride order + mirror checks.  
- Protocol if separated: stop at next fuel station/town, wait X minutes, regroup.  
- Daily rendezvous points marked on map.  
- Offline maps/GPX tracks in case phones die.  

### Breakdowns & Emergencies
- What does rental insurance cover (flat, tow, crash)?  
- Contact protocol if bike disabled — rental shop, JAF roadside, local police?  
- Carry basic tool kit / tire plug kit, or rely fully on service?  
- Fuel protocol — top up nightly or run low?  
- Escort stranded rider or split group?  
- Pre-agreed emergency meet spots each day.  

### General Practicalities
- Seasonal closures: Norikura Skyline, Oze-Toge late Oct?  
- Fuel range between stations in Tadami/Okukinu areas.  
- Navigation: Google Maps vs. GPX vs. paper.  
- Cash vs. card acceptance in rural inns/shops.  
- Language: enough English signage, or memorize key Japanese phrases?
