I don't want a pickle  
Just want to ride on my motorcycle ("sickel")  
And I don't want a tickle  
'Cause I'd rather ride on my motorcycle  
And I don't want to die  
I just want to ride on my motor-cy ... cul

## Logistics Questions

### Luggage & Storage
- Where do big suitcases stay during the trip? (rental shop storage, hotel, luggage forwarding service)  
- Do bikes come with panniers/top cases or only a rack?  
- Minimum daily storage — Dopp kit, meds, headlamp, charger.  
- Helmet lock / cable lock needed for stops?  

### Laundry & Clothing
- Plan to do laundry mid-trip (coin laundromat, hotel washer) or pack for all 6 days?  
- Quick-dry layers for sink washing vs. cotton bulk?  
- Schedule a laundry day in Matsumoto or Aizu?  

### Accommodations
- Book all stays a week+ in advance, night before, or roll into town?  
- October = peak leaf season — will walk-ins be available?  
- Confirm motorcycle parking at each inn/ryokan.  
- Cancellation flexibility (Booking.com, Rakuten Travel)?  

### Bikes & Rental Practicalities
- What models available (dual-sport vs. ADV-tourer)?  
- Insurance coverage: does it include roadside/towing?  
- Add-on panniers/top case available?  
- How are tolls handled (ETC card vs. cash)?  
- GPS mounts included, or bring RAM mounts?  

### Rider Communication
- Helmet comms (Cardo/Sena) or just hand signals?  
- Backup: group chat + live location sharing (LINE/WhatsApp/Google).  
- Agreed signals for stop, hazard, fuel, slow down, speed up.  
- Portable battery packs for phones/GPS.  

### Group Riding & Separation
- Ride order + mirror checks.  
- Protocol if separated: stop at next fuel station/town, wait X minutes, regroup.  
- Daily rendezvous points marked on map.  
- Offline maps/GPX tracks in case phones die.  

### Breakdowns & Emergencies
- What does rental insurance cover (flat, tow, crash)?  
- Contact protocol if bike disabled — rental shop, JAF roadside, local police?  
- Carry basic tool kit / tire plug kit, or rely fully on service?  
- Fuel protocol — top up nightly or run low?  
- Escort stranded rider or split group?  
- Pre-agreed emergency meet spots each day.  

### General Practicalities
- Seasonal closures: Norikura Skyline, Oze-Toge late Oct?  
- Fuel range between stations in Tadami/Okukinu areas.  
- Navigation: Google Maps vs. GPX vs. paper.  
- Cash vs. card acceptance in rural inns/shops.  
- Language: enough English signage, or memorize key Japanese phrases?

## Logistics Questions

### Questions, conversations, pertinent, English language

**What are you guys doing for gear?**  
Helmet, gloves, boots, jacket, pants — i.e. your standard fare. Renting it along with the bikes or packing it out from CO? _Packing everything except bikes out from CO_

**If you're traveling with gear (great example: helmet),**
You're probably checking a bag on a long-haul flight to Japan. When you start this moto trip, what are you doing with your suitcase, and your change of clothes, while you moto around this 5–6 day trip?

**Where are you planning to do laundry, even _if_ you are going to do laundry?**

**What storage do the rental bikes offer?**  
What are minimal requirements? Do they have space for a Dopp kit with toothbrush/medication and maybe a headlamp or change of socks?

**Accommodation.**  
Is this a book-the-hotel-a-week-in-advance thing, the night before, or roll into town and find a vacancy sign?

**How do riders communicate along the way?**  
If riders all have varied/minimal equipment, and riders have all ridden together for a rough total of 2 days, how to communicate:  
- when to stop  
- when to pee  
- hazards  
- slow down  
- speed up  
- I'm uncomfortable  
- I'm out of gas  
- we're lost  
- etc.

**How do riders even know if they're separated?**  
If it's a three-up (current plan + one friend invite), two can be off cruising and the third can be just leisurely enjoying themself at the back, not realizing how much they're slowing down until the sun is down and they can't find the other two. Being in Japan, with limited language and perhaps a classic dance move as communication, how does one not feel f-ed in that situation?

**Riders should also think, in advance, about breakdowns.**  
What happens with a flat tire, a gravel road bent-rim, empty fuel, loose handlebars? What's the protocol there?
